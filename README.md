# OVERVIEW:
- The Java-based ATM Project is a digital banking terminal that allows individuals to perform basic transactions independently, without the need for tellers or branch staff. With a credit or debit card, users can conveniently access cash at most ATMs.
- ATMs offer convenience by empowering customers to engage in self-service operations such as making deposits, withdrawing cash, paying bills, and transferring funds between accounts.
- The bank that holds the account or the ATM operator often impose charges for cash withdrawals. However, utilizing an ATM directly operated by the account-holding bank can help avoid or reduce these fees, as it eliminates the involvement of additional parties.

# JAVA-BASED AUTOMATED TELLER MACHINE:
- In Java, we can create an ATM simulation program to demonstrate ATM transactions. The user is presented with a set of options on the ATM application screen: withdrawing money, depositing money, checking the balance, and exiting.
- For withdrawing money, we prompt the user to enter the withdrawal amount, deduct it from the total balance, and display a success message.
- For depositing money, we ask the user for the deposit amount, add it to the total balance, and display a success message.
- To check the balance, we simply display the user's current total balance.
- To exit the current transaction mode and return the user to the home page or initial screen, we can utilize the exit(0) method.

# ABOUT THE PROJECT:
- ATM Project In Java was created with the Java Programming Language and a MySQL Database for data storage. This ATM Program In Java With Database was designed with a Graphical User Interface (GUI), and this ATM Program is suitable for students or beginners who wish to learn Java Programming.
- An ATM Machine Program is a type of electronic banking terminal that allows consumers to do simple transactions without the assistance of a teller or branch employee.

# MAJOR FUNCTIONALITIES OF THE SYSTEM: 
- Deposits
